I just can't wait
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
You
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Yeah
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby (Yeahhh)
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
For my own
Baby
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby

Bah Humbug, now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year
Ski shop encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines
So deck those halls Trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year
Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens Sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summertime
Out to the beach to his boat
Could I join him?
No This time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP
No, thanks No party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time
A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone, ' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays
We've been waiting all year for this night
And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings are hung by the fire side
Waitng for Santa to arrive
And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmastime and
All the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of the year for the family
It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room

Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Ra pum pum pum
Ra pum pum pum
Ra pum pum pum
Ra pum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum
Yeah, I'm on the stand drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And they only spare heat 'cause I'm playing for the sun
Playing for the King, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael I know
I'm still young but I go I go
Stupid, stupid, love like cupid
I'ma drummer boy so do, do
Little baby
Pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too
Pa rum pum pum pum (gather round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(He he matter fact let's gather round the fireplace while we get hot here)
That's fit to give our King, (Bieber what'd up?)
Pa rum pum pum pum, (yeah)
Ra pum pum pum, (yeah)
Ra pum pum pum (yeah) (I'm gonna get straight to it)
At the table with the family
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker
Then it gave a lil' flicker then
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter
I said cool, cool
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah!
Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the stand
It's crazy how some people say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you give to charity
Rarely do people, don't wanna even help at all
'Cause they wont bother buying, getting toys, getting dolls
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe
I'ma drummer boy so do, do
I'ma drummer boy so do, do
I'ma drummer boy so do, do

And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m, so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It’s Dee-ricious”

I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York I’m still reppin' for the A

Santa’s on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Down town got me feeling like it’s Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like it's down home
Snow like sugar hill
Chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?
Oh, pause for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment
Where’s your NoDoz pills
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel
Hope you know those real
Okay my white girl Veronica
Black girl Monica

Rocking dashikis with a yarmulke

Lenox Ave to Saint Nick
Never seen St Nick
Just niggas selling the same nicks, the same bricks
Same hustlers running up the broadway
That's where the snow’s at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo’s
Christmas lights in project windows
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah (My lawyers)
All the flashin’ lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit’ your family’s where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hoo-hood
All of the flashin’ lights
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it
Now, I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now, I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special

Candles burning low, lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols right outside my door
All these things and more
(All these things and more)
Now that's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
I see your smiling face like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly, it seems I love you more
The little cards you give me will touch my heart for sure
All these things and more, my darling
(All these things and more)
Oh, that's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As anxious as a little child
To push you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once and then some more
Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
Let's deck the halls with holly, sing sweet ?Silent Night?
Fill a tree with the angel hair and pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up just before daylight
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Christmas, Christmas means to me
That's what it means, that's what it means
Deck the halls with balls of holly
'Tis the season to be jolly
That's what, that's what Christmas
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
That's what Christmas means to me
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

A crop jacket and dirty denim jeans
On the fifth day of Christmas my baby gave to me
The poem that he wrote for me
The feeling that I feel is so good, he makes me feel so in la-la-la-la-love

The keys to a CLK Mercedes

Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal
Frosty the Snowman
Made the children laugh and play
And were they surprised when
Before their eyes
He came to life that day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have fun
Now before I melt away
So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see you walking around the room
Let it snow, it's blasting now
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if it's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, babe
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year
Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by the fire place, oh-oh-oh
But I don't want no broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
If you want me, if you want me
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year
